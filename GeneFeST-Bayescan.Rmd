So this is very exploratory in nature - stumbled across this package, which will in essence take a Bayesian approach to identifying Fst outliers in genomic data.  We're just going to walk through the demo (if we can)
```{r}
#install.packages("GeneFeST")
```
```{r}
library(GeneFeST)
library(PopGenome)
```
OK.  So we should be able to do this, without grouping, with the test file distributed with Bayescan:

```{r}
res <-GeneFeST(input="./Bayescan/snp.txt",GROUP=FALSE)
```
