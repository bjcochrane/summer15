###  Goals

We want to end up with a multipopulation database, consisting of snps for which ancestral and derived states are known.  So to do that, we have to start as follows:

1.  Get a list of snps in snpmart
2.  Eliminate those without ancestral data.
3.  Do an intersect with the snps in Hapmap
4.  Sample these and create a master data set
5.  Go from there.

```{r}
library(biomaRt)
```
```{r}
snp <-useMart("snp")
```
```{r}
listDatasets(snp)
```
```{r}
snp.dat <-useMart("snp",dataset="hsapiens_snp")
```
```{r}
listAttributes(snp.dat)
```
```{r}
listFilters(snp.dat)
```
So to choke the horse, we will now do a search, saving and committing this file before doing so,
